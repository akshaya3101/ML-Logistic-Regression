**Basic Logistic Regression**
This notebook (logistic regression.ipynb) demonstrates a basic logistic regression pipeline on a smaller health-related dataset for binary outcome prediction.

**Key steps:**

Data loading and inspection

Selecting and preparing relevant features

Training a logistic regression model

Evaluating using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix

Dataset:
Book1.csv – a small dataset used to illustrate the basic principles of logistic regression.

Objective:
To provide a minimalistic and educational example of logistic regression that can be adapted to other binary classification tasks.





**Cardiovascular Disease Prediction - Logistic Regression**
This notebook (logistic regression_cardiovascular disease.ipynb) implements a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease using clinical and lifestyle data.

**Key steps:**

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling)

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

Training a logistic regression model

Evaluating performance using metrics like:

Accuracy

Confusion matrix

Classification report

Basic visualizations for better insight into model predictions

Dataset:
health_data.csv – containing variables like age, gender, systolic/diastolic BP, cholesterol, glucose, smoking status, and target (cardiovascular disease: 0/1).

Objective:
To create a simple, interpretable machine learning pipeline to assess heart disease risk based on patient health profiles.
